This I get from a StartdLog from the JobAD

LigoSearchTag = "ligo.prod.o3.burst.paramest.bayeswave"
LigoSearchUser = "katerina.chatziioannou"
UserLog = "/home/katerina.chatziioannou/BayesWave_dev/AmplitudePrior/Peak4/logs/BayesWavePost_trigtime_1243531815.461905003_0.0_0.0_17-18954161-0.log"
x509userproxy = "/home/katerina.chatziioannou/BayesWave_dev/AmplitudePrior/Peak4/x509up_u44299"
x509UserProxyExpiration = 1591774653
x509userproxysubject = "/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=LIGO/CN=Katerina Chatziioannou katerina.chatziioannou@ligo.org”

So as a rule of thumb any lune that includes User should be anonymized.  There are also these lines: However there are exceptions like:

RemoteUserCpu

06/03/20 08:26:03 (pid:45426) slot1_1: Remote owner is katerina.chatziioannou@ligo

06/03/20 08:26:06 (pid:45426) slot1_1: Got activate_claim request from shadow (131.215.11

But I do not thing they are as important

For the rest I would say that is the really only important stuff


I would say that remove all the occurrences of "user" is eccessive but there are some good suggestions on classads that should be redacted.
